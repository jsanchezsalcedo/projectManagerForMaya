# Project Manager v1.1.1

  <b>Updates</b>
  
  Cleaned and optimized part of the code to be more readable.
  
  <b>Issues</b>
    
  It is still having a bug when you change of project after opening an asset of another project previously selected, this duplicates the process when you select an asset and open it. If you are always working on the same project, there is no problem.


At the moment, the solution to this issue is, change the project and select the asset in what you want to work, the project manager saves the level which you are, close it and open it again, then you could work fine in this project.

Sorry for the inconveniences, I am learning at the same time I am working on this script and hope to find a solution as soon as will be possible.

Thanks!
